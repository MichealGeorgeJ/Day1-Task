2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

#Objects are important data types in javascript.
# Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).
# Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
# These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

#var myCar = new Object();

#myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

#myCar.model = 'Altros';

#myCar.year = 1978;

#myCar.wheels = 2;

#After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
